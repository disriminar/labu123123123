        <p>
            The elegant new Pod-system from Juul will definitely find its fans among people who, for various reasons, like to soar, but try not to advertise their sweet, fragrant habit. These people know what style is and do not think of themselves outside of style. They care what device they hold in their hand. As a rule, they are ready to pay any check, just to get not only a portion of nicotine, but also aesthetic pleasure from the whole vaping process, including even the external surroundings.

            Juul - the system is simple and concise, there are no buttons or other controls. The device starts working on its own with every puff of the bather and actually simulates the process of smoking regular cigarettes. The rectangular battery pack is made of a weightless aluminum alloy and weighs only 15 grams when combined with an unused cartridge. Device dimensions: 95 mm x 15 mm x 7 mm. On the front plane there is an indicator light that glows during use to reflect the tightening force and when charging the device. The green indication notifies of a high battery charge, yellow - medium charge level and red, respectively, warns of the need to charge the battery immediately.
           
            The battery capacity of the Pod-system is 200.0 mAh, this charge is enough for 200 puffs or continuous operation of the device for 12 hours. For charging, Juul is inserted with its lower part, on which the contact group is located, into the socket of a magnetic docking station, which, in turn, is connected via a USB connector to any device or power bank connected to the network. One hour is enough to fully charge Juul.
