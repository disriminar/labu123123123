            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
            
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
            
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]

        <header>Html. How does it work?</header>
        <p>
            HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser, like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. You can use anything from a rudimentary text-editor to a powerful graphical editor to create HTML pages.

            Html Tag HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

            Syntax: 
        </p>
        <code> <*tag> content <*/tag> </code>
        <p>
            HTML Tag Examples
            Note: HTML is not case sensitive language so you can write Html Tags in lowercase or uppercase letters. Some Html tags are given below;
        </p>
        <p>
            <code> Unclosed Html Tags
            Some Html tags are not closed, for example<*br>, <*hr>, <*img> etc.
            
            <*br> Tag: br stands for break line, it breaks the line of the code.
            
            <*hr> Tag: hr stands for Horizontal Rule. This tag is used to put a line across the webpage.
            
            <*img> Tag: img tag are use for display image on web page.
          
           
          </code>
          This block of code contains two statements that output a specific line
          to the console.

            What does The HTML Comment Tag: Here's How To Use It In Your Code do?
            This element is used to add a comment to an HTML document. An HTML comment begins with <*!–– and the comment closes with ––*>. HTML comments are visible to anyone that views the page source code, but are not rendered when the HTML document is rendered by a browser.
